# Your Project Title
Horiseon website improvements
## Description 
In this project I clarified the code I was given to make it coherent and logical. To achieve this, I used my previous knowledge of SCSS to make the existing css file for this webiste easier to read, as well as renaming classes to improve the clarity and condense the code. These improvements should prove useful for future web-developers that work on Horiseon's website.
